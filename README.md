The Glucagon_Analysis program is for analyzing a timed reaction of islet cells that were imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal.


The MultiplexCellTyping and PlotMultiplex programs do much as the names suggest. They were for a HiPlex RNAscope experiment performed on CNS tissue and imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal. Example data is included in the Multiplex_example_data.csv file. The cell types identified are astrocytes, neurons, and microglia.
